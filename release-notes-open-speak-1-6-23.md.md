## Updates:

**Summary**:

-   Fixed bug with Phone Input component, where users were unable to enter the full 10 digit phone number if they
    did not click the very left part of the field.

**Key Changes**:

-   The cursor will always be positioned at the last number entered by the user, regardless of where they click on the input field.

-   Disabled text mask guide visibility as this was confusing the state of the cursor.

-   OI-133: Issue with phone number field in callback plugins
